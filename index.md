## **Growth Mindset**

Growth mindset is a concept that believes intelligence and talent are starting points and your success can still be developed; this contrasts with fixed mindset, where your starting talent and intelligence determine your success. 

### **Three Ways I Keep a Growth Mindset**
1. Learn from criticism instead of ignoring it.
1. Puting in effort.
1. Take on challenges instead of avoiding it.

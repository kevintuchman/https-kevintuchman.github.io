## **Me**

Hi, my name is Kevin Tuchman and this is my learning journal. I'm taking this course for a career change from the seaman industry.  [Link to profile](https://github.com/kevintuchman)

## **Growth Mindset**

Growth mindset is a concept that believes intelligence and talent are starting points and your success can still be developed; this contrasts with fixed mindset, where your starting talent and intelligence determine your success. Examples of fixed mindset are: avoiding challenges because they cause discomfort, ignoring helpful criticism, and losing focus when a problem becomes difficult and persists. Fixed mindset isn't helpful because it doesn't help with learning, unlike a growth mindset, which helps you learn and grow.

## **Three Ways I Keep a Growth Mindset**
1. *Learn from criticism instead of ignoring it.*
1. *Puting in effort.*
1. *Take on challenges instead of avoiding it.*

## **Markdown**

Markdown is a syntax that is easy to learn and is used to add style to your text on your website. Example of Markdown include:
```javascript
# for title size (between 1 and 6)
** for bold
* for itallics

I learned this once recently to make a task list box: 
Title 1 | TItle 2
info | info
info | info
info | info

~~strikethrough~~
```

Even though you could memorize all the syntax, you should just bookmark the list [instead](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). Also, Github has its own version of Markdown syntax so some Markdown may not work here, possibly. Even though I'm a novice at coding, I found Markdown easier to learn compared to other syntax because it only requires you to use non-alphabetic characters to use.

## Lab 02 "Cheat Sheet"

pwd - print working directory

ls - list

path – means to get to a particular file or directory; there are two types of paths: absolute or relative 

cd – change directories

ls -a – lists the contents of directory e.g. hidden files

command line (could also be called a terminal) – text-based interface to the system

version control system (vcs) – system that allows you to check various versions of your files and do the following: revert a file/project, track modifications, modifying, and comparing change

GIT – VCS that allows multiple developers to work on the same code

Commit – a saved, changed version of your file; each commit has a short, sweet message attached.

HEAD – “You Are Here”

Github – website to store and share code

Repository – collection of files on Github or on your computer

git add --all

git commit -m "description"

mkdr – make directory

git push origin master

git status

git clone

## Text Editors

There are two options for text editors: the editor that comes with your computer and third-party options. The editors that comes with your computer don't have many features to tinker with. Third party editors have better settings and more options for extensions and are generally better. Third party editors also have communities that share tips and can answer questions. For example, Notepad++ has a community and a wiki for research. However, you should use an editor that works for you; doesn't matter if it's the basic Notepad of fancy Visual Studio Code.

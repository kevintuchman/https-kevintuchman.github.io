## **Growth Mindset**

Growth mindset is a concept that believes intelligence and talent are starting points and your success can still be developed; this contrasts with fixed mindset, where your starting talent and intelligence determine your success. Examples of fixed mindset are: avoiding challenges because they cause discomfort, ignoring helpful criticism, and losing focus when a problem becomes difficult and persists. Fixed mindset isn't helpful because it doesn't help with learning, unlike a growth mindset, which helps you learn and grow.

### **Three Ways I Keep a Growth Mindset**
1. *Learn from criticism instead of ignoring it.*
1. *Puting in effort.*
1. *Take on challenges instead of avoiding it.*

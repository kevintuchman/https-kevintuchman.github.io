## **Growth Mindset**

Growth mindset is a concept that believes intelligence and talent are starting points and your success can still be developed; this contrasts with fixed mindset, where your starting talent and intelligence determine your success. Examples of fixed mindset are: avoiding challenges because they cause discomfort, ignoring helpful criticism, and losing focus when a problem becomes difficult and persists. Fixed mindset isn't helpful because it doesn't help with learning, unlike a growth mindset, which helps you learn and grow.

## **Three Ways I Keep a Growth Mindset**
1. *Learn from criticism instead of ignoring it.*
1. *Puting in effort.*
1. *Take on challenges instead of avoiding it.*

## **Markdown**

Markdown is a syntax that is easy to learn and is used to add style to your text on your website. Example of Markdown include:
```javascript
# for title size (between 1 and 6)
** for bold
* for itallics

I learned this once recently to make a task list box: 
Title 1 | TItle 2
info | info
info | info
info | info

~~strikethrough~~
```

Even though you could memorize all the syntax, you should just bookmark the list [instead](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). Also, Github has its own version of Markdown syntax so some Markdown may not work here, possibly. Even though I'm a novice at coding, I found Markdown easier to learn compared to other syntax because it only requires you to use non-alphabetic characters to use.

Git Intro

Version Control - system that allows you to revist changes in files or a set of files

Local Version Control stores changes on the hard disk; Centralized Version Control stores changes on a server for a team; Distributed Version Control allows clients to create mirrored repositories. Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots.

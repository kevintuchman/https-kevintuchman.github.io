HTML & CSS

Several different versions of HTML have been released: HTML 4 came out in 1997; XHTML 1.0 came out in 2000; and HTML 5 is a work in progress.

If you want to show code like this (&lt;div&gt;) without it being read as code, then you need to use escape characters, which consist of symbols.
